## 🎨 Visual Theme

The dashboard embraces a dark, atmospheric aesthetic, drawing inspiration from cosmic horror and ancient, primal forces. This is brought to life through:
*   A dark color palette (deep grays, muted blues, occasional contrasting highlights).
*   Customizable icons for different link types.
*   Text and page-wide glitch animations that periodically distort the view, enhancing the unsettling yet captivating feel.
*   A carefully chosen background image that complements the theme.

## 🏁 Getting Started

1.  **Serve Files**: Since this project uses ES Modules directly, you'll need to serve the files using a simple HTTP server.
    *   If you have Node.js, you can use `npx serve .` from the project's root directory.
    *   Alternatively, use any other static file server or a browser extension designed for local development.
2.  **Open in Browser**: Navigate to `index.html` through your local server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## 📲 Installing as a PWA

Once loaded in a compatible browser, you can install Primal Nexus Dashboard:

*   **Desktop (Chrome, Edge)**: Look for an "Install" icon in the address bar or within the browser's main menu (usually under "Apps" or "More tools").
*   **Mobile (Android - Chrome, iOS - Safari)**: Use the "Add to Home Screen" option found in your browser's share menu or settings.
